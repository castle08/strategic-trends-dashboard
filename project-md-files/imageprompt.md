	‚Ä¢	Perspective: Slightly angled from above, showing depth and dimension.
	‚Ä¢	Primary color tone: #803bff (trend category colour) (purple) used prominently in lighting, accents, and key elements.

	‚Ä¢	Symbolism: A large glowing 3D icon of two hands shaking above the island, with the word ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù in glowing 3D neon letters below it. Surround with floating holographic smartphone screens displaying social media profiles, likes, comments, and ‚Äúverified‚Äù badges. Include small human figures interacting with the environment, symbolizing micro-influencers and their followers.
	‚Ä¢	Lighting: Studio-quality lighting with soft shadows and realistic reflections. Integrate glowing neon light trails connecting devices and people to convey a digital network.

// Generate image prompt for single trend

const trend = $json.trend;

// Use the existing imagePrompt as the base, or create one from the title
const basePrompt = trend.creative?.imagePrompt || `a 3D wireframe floating island`;

// Create the detailed prompt
const imagePrompt = `Create a hyper-detailed, high quality render of ${basePrompt} representing "${trend.title}" in the ${trend.category} category.

Style:
‚Ä¢ Clean 3D wireframe with thin, glowing lines and geometric shapes
‚Ä¢ Symbolism: Include visual elements symbolizing the trend theme "${trend.title}" and its significance in ${trend.category}
‚Ä¢ Materials: Transparent surfaces with visible wireframe edges
‚Ä¢ Primary color tone: Use ${trend.viz.colorHint} prominently in lighting, accents, and key elements
‚Ä¢ Lighting: Subtle glow along the wireframe lines with ${trend.viz.colorHint} color
‚Ä¢ Background: Transparent PNG with alpha channel (no sky or scenery)
‚Ä¢ Format: 1024x1024 PNG with transparent background`;

console.log(`üìù Generated image prompt for "${trend.title}": ${imagePrompt.substring(0, 100)}...`);

return [{
  json: {
    trend: trend,
    imagePrompt: imagePrompt,

**Database Tool Instructions:**

**Purpose:** Check for existing trends to avoid duplicates and build on previous insights.

**How to Use:**
1. **Before creating new trends**, query the database to see what trends already exist
2. **Search for similar topics** to avoid creating duplicate trends
3. **Build on existing insights** - if a similar trend exists, enhance it rather than duplicate
4. **Check recent trends** from the last few weeks to understand current focus areas

**Query Strategy:**
- Search by category (e.g., "AI", "Retail", "Creativity")
- Search by keywords from your identified trends
- Check for trends with similar titles or themes
- Look at recent trend scores to understand what's already been identified

**Integration with Analysis:**
- If similar trends exist, focus on new angles or emerging variations
- If no similar trends exist, this confirms your trend is novel
- Use existing trend data to inform your scoring and confidence levels
- Reference previous successful trends to improve your creative content

**Example Database Queries:**
- "Show me recent AI trends"
- "Find trends related to retail media"
- "What creativity trends exist from the last month?"
- "Check for trends about consumer behavior changes"

**Remember:** The database is your memory of what's already been analyzed. Use it to make your new trends more valuable and avoid repetition.
